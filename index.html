        <p><strong>Alfons Maria Mucha</strong>; (24 July 1860 – 14 July 1939), known internationally as Alphonse Mucha,
            was a Czech
            <strong>painter, illustrator</strong> and <strong>graphic artist</strong>, living in Paris during the
            <em><strong>Art Nouveau</strong></em> period, <strong>best known
                for</strong> his
            distinctly stylized and decorative <strong>theatrical posters</strong>, particularly those of <em>Sarah
                Bernhardt</em> <a class="link-green" target="_blank" href="sources.html">[1]</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Sarah Bernhardt played Mélissinde in Edmon Rostand's play La Princesse lointaine at the Théâtre de la
            Renaissance in Paris from April 1895.

            This poster, which breaks away from Mucha's full-length depictions of the actress, was created for a banquet
            organised by Bernhardt's friends and admirers at the Grand Hotel in Paris on 9 December 1896.

            The poster proved so popular that it was reproduced in La Plume magazine, the Edition d'Art and as a
            postcard for the department store La Belle Jardinière.

            Bernhardt wears a tiara in her hair adorned with lilies that was designed by Mucha <a class="link-green"

        <p>He produced illustrations, advertisements, decorative panels, as well as designs, which became among the
            best-known images of the period.</p>

        <p> In the second part of his career, at the age of 57, he returned to his homeland and devoted himself to a
            series of twenty monumental canvases known as <strong>The Slav Epic</strong>, depicting the history of all
            the Slavic peoples
            of the world, which he painted between 1912 and 1926. In 1928, on the 10th anniversary of the independence
            of Czechoslovakia, he presented the series to the Czech nation. He considered it <strong>his most important
                work</strong> <a class="link-green" target="_blank" href="sources.html">[1]</a>.</p>
